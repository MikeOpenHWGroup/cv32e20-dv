# We want to instrument and collect code coverage for the CORE and all levels
# of hierarchy below the top of the core. In the DSIM compile-time args, the
# top is defined as uvmt_cv32e20_tb, so compile-time command to enable code
# coverage looks something like:
# 
#  dsim -top uvmt_cv32e20_tb \
#       -code-cov block:expression \
#       -code-cov-scope-specs ccov_scopes.txt \
#       -f $(MANIFEST)
#
# Path to the top-level of the CV32E20 RTL core.
